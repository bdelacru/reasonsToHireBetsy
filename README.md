## ü™ß Setup & Local Development

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.template .env  # populate secrets for DB + Cloudinary
npm install -g env-cmd  # if needed
env-cmd -f .env mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.local.template .env.local  # set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ‚ùå Common Errors + Workarounds

### Tailwind not working in Vite
- Caused by incorrect PostCSS plugin setup.
```js
// postcss.config.js
import tailwindcss from 'tailwindcss';
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';
export default { plugins: [tailwindcss, autoprefixer] };
```

### Spring Boot fails with missing main class
- Fixed by adding `mainClass` to `spring-boot-maven-plugin` in `backend/pom.xml`

### Flyway Errors
- Column already exists ‚Üí drop the column or increment Flyway version
- No schema history table ‚Üí add `baselineOnMigrate: true`

### Frontend build fails on Vercel
- Caused by missing image assets or Rollup bug
- Fixed by restoring image paths and reinstalling dependencies

### CORS error
- Resolved via Spring `CorsConfig`:
```java
.allowedOriginPatterns("https://reasons-to-hire-betsy.vercel.app", "http://localhost:5173")
```

### Render: `mvn` not found
- Switched to Docker-based deployment or custom Maven installation
